## ANDE Ecosystem Application 

### About ANDE 
The Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE) is a global membership network of organizations that 
propel entrepreneurship in emerging markets. ANDE members provide critical financial, educational, and business 
support services to small and growing businesses (SGBs) based on the conviction that SGBs will create jobs, 
stimulate long-term economic growth, and produce environmental and social benefits. Ultimately, we believe that 
SGBs can help lift countries out of poverty.

ANDE supports our 200+ members, and is building a movement of support for Small and Growing Businesses (SGBs) by providing:

• Knowledge Sharing and Networking
• Training and Talent Development
• Metrics and Evaluation
• Research
• Funding Opportunities
• Advocacy and Education

## Usage

### The ANDY EcoSystem 
Entrepreneurs should be able to search for the organizations that can help them.
In present system, workers manually generate a static pdf with the existing data per country.
There is huge data that has to be represented in one page. Hard to read.
Our application provides a simple interface using which the users can filter organization information.
Charts are generated dynamically so it changes with the data and the filters.
The stage of the companies that the organizations are supporting are visually represented.
Other services offered by organizations are shown as tags

#Why the PayPal Opportunity Hack?
The PayPal Hack gives us a unique opportunity to demonstrate how technology
can help ANDY modernize and automate a process that is currently done
with lot of work to create and generate PDF's per country for both organizations and members to compare and pick.

Technology/Application can be a real enabler to link SalesForce and
specifically EcoSystem of ANDY.  

The web application has been written to allow Entrepreneurs and Organisations to
visualise via a simple online form and verify the gaps.
